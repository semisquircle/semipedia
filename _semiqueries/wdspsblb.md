title: "Why do some people say \"both\" like \"bolth\"?"

tldr: "With a lack of closed-lip consonant sounds, \"well\" is sometimes pronounced easier with less demanding phonemes such as \"u\" or \"oo\"."

In most North American English dialects, the pronunciation of the /o:/ is less diphthongized than elsewhere, which makes it significantly closer to a pure long "o" than in Received pronunciation. Because of this, when the tongue moves toward the front of the mouth in order to articulate the "th" at the end of "both", it passes very close to where a *postvocalic* /l/ would normally be articulated. Depending on the individual or the dialect, an "l" sound can sometimes be heard.

This is also commonly mispronounced by children who are 8 years or younger. Between ages 5 and 8, /l/ and /th/ are the fourth and third last phenomes to be mastered completely and are often switched around.
