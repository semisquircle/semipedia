There are many types of seams on which a skitch can form. Depending on the product, its fabric, and its physical use (such as how a clothing item lays and bends on the body), seams such as welt seams, felled seams, french seams, and bound seams may lead to the formation of one or more skitches.

The presence or absence of skitches in a product does not usually signify anything of manufacturing importance. Sometimes skitches are intentionally included, and other times they're not. They appear to be a natural and unavoidable part of stitching, sewing, and textile crafting.
