Fussifrases are often used when an individual wants to contribute to a conversation but has nothing meaningful to say. They are defined by their word choice, often including adverbs like "very," "really," "many," "pretty," or "so" that taint the phrase/sentence with an inherently vague and unspecific remark. Other times, they include modal auxiliaries such as "should," "would," "can," "will," or "might" that make the phrase/sentence vague in its sense of purpose or obligation.

Fussifrases are meant to be specifically unspecific, however this can be subjective. They are very much dependant upon the context of which they are shoehorned into. Here are a few clearcut examples of them:

* *"That mountain looks really big. I bet it's pretty far away."*
* *"Ethan is usually pretty nice. I wonder why he's being weird."*
* *"That price seems good. We will talk about it later."*
