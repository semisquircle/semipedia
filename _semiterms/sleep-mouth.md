<sup>1</sup>[Halitosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halitosis){:.inline}{:target="_blank"}, or bad breath, is a condition in which a person emanates an unattractive odor from their mouth. This is commonly experienced upon awakening from sleep and caused by the buildup of bacteria in the mouth from decreased saliva production.

A <sup>2</sup>[biofilm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biofilm){:.inline}{:target="_blank"} is a thin, slimy film of bacteria that adheres to a bodily surface, most often ones of moisture and low physical disturbances, such as the human mouth during sleep. Not much is known about the exact cause of sleep-related biofilm, as some never experience it. No harmful effects have been found related to it. However, daily teeth brushing and use of a proper mouthwash before and after sleep can help reduce its occurrences.
