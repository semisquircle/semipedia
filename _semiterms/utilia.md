Utilia is most usually felt when one's cursor changes from the default arrow to a pointer hand, such as when hovering over [this text](javascript:void(0)){:.inline}. In UI design, a pointer cursor is reserved for buttons or links that cause significant action, such as saving or redirecting.

Different variations of utilia are also commonly experienced, and may warrant additional semiterms in the future.
