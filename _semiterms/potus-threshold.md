The POTUS threshold relates only to the American voting public's projected opinion, as no actions that would preclude an otherwise qualified US citizen of becoming president are specified in the US Constitution.

Actions proven to "cross" the POTUS threshold:
* Being convicted of first degree murder
* Violently threatening a congress member
* Performing a [Dean scream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_scream){:.inline}{:target="_blank"}
