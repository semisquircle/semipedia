The POTUS threshold relates only to the American voting public's projected opinion, as no actions that would preclude an otherwise qualified US citizen of becoming president are specified in the US Constitution.

Swift POTUS threshold disqualifiers can be considered the following:
* Committing first degree murder
* Enacting forced labor
* Sudden poverty
